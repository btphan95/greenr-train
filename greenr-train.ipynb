Inspired by [Lesson 2](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=2) of FastAI. Thanks to Francisco Ingham and Jeremy Howard* \n\nIn this tutorial, we'll create an image dataset from Google Images and train a state-of-the-art image classifier extremely easily using the FastAI library. The FastAI library is built on top of the PyTorch deep learning framework, and provides commands that make training an image classifier very intuitive.\n\nFor this tutorial, we'll build a dandelion vs. grass classifier.

Initially, there will be ~50 images, so scroll down and press the button 'Show more results' at the end of the page until ~100 images have loaded. \n\nNow you must run some Javascript code in your browser which will save the URLs of all the images you want for you dataset.\n\nPress CtrlShiftJ in Windows/Linux and CmdOptJ in Mac, and a small window the javascript 'Console' will appear. That is where you will paste the JavaScript commands.\n\nRun the following commands in the prompt:\n\n```\nurls = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.rg_di .rg_meta')).map(el=>JSON.parse(el.textContent).ou);\nwindow.open('data:text/csv;charset=utf-8,' + escape(urls.join('\\n')));\n```\n\nThe browser will download the file. Name the file *grass.csv*.\n\nRepeat the same steps above for *dandelion*, and save the respective file as *dandelion.csv*.\n\n**Upload the URLs as a dataset in Kaggle**\n\nIn this Kaggle kernel, go to File -> Add or upload data\n\nIn the top right corner, press Upload\n\nNow, add *grass.csv* and *dandelion.csv*.
